Author: Rory Fitzpatrick

This directory contains tools for visualizing trajcluster shower reconstruction
at intermediate stages. To compile the tool

> cd /larreco/RecoAlg/TCAlg/TCDebugTools/
> make

This produces the executable 'tc_sh_debugger' which can be executed as follows:

> tc_sh_debugger [inputfile]

Output files will be placed in the folder tc_sh_debug_output in your working 
directory. The folder will be created if it does not already exist.

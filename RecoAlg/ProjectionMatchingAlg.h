// Class:       ProjectionMatchingAlg

//
// Projection Matching Algorithm
// see RecoAlg/PMAlg/PmaTrack3D.h for more details.
//
//      Build 3D segments and whole tracks by matching an object 2D projections to hits, simultaneously
//      in multiple wire planes. Based on the algorithm first presented in "Precise 3D track reco..."
//      AHEP (2013) 260820, with all the tricks that we developed later and with the work for the full-event
//      topology optimization that is still under construction now (2015).
//
//      The algorithm class provides functionality to build a track from selected hits. These
//      can be detailed tracks or just simple segments (if the number of nodes to add is set to 0).
//      The parameters of optimization algorithm, fixed nodes and 3D reference points can be configured here.
//      Please, check the track making module to find a way of selecting appropriate clusteres:
//        PMAlgTrackMaker_module.cc
